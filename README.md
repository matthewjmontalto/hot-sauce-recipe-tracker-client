## Thank You!

Thank you for reviewing my application!

Developing any recipe is a process of practice and refinement. Such is especially
the case for developing hot sauce recipes.

This is an application that users may use to store, track, and refine their
hot sauce recipes. The front end links with a database which was designed to
accommodate the data elements specific to hot sauce, such as ingredients used
and whether the recipe involves a fermentation step, for example. Users will
be required to establish an account, so that they may track thier recipes without
risk of affecting another user's recipes.
